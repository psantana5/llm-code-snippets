Large Language Models (LLMs) Code Examples and Tutorials
Welcome to the LLMs Code Examples and Tutorials Repository! This repository is a curated collection of code examples, tutorials, and practical resources designed to help developers and researchers better understand, implement, and optimize Large Language Models (LLMs), with a particular focus on the Transformer architecture.

üìö Overview
Large Language Models have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by enabling applications such as text generation, summarization, translation, question answering, and more. This repository aims to provide hands-on resources for learning and working with LLMs, including:

Code Implementations: Step-by-step examples of key concepts in LLMs.

Tutorials: Detailed guides explaining the theory and practical aspects of Transformers and LLMs.

Applications: Real-world use cases such as chatbots, sentiment analysis, and text classification.

Optimization Techniques: Methods to improve performance, reduce computational costs, and fine-tune models.

Whether you're a beginner looking to understand Transformers or an experienced practitioner exploring advanced techniques for LLMs, this repository has something for you!
